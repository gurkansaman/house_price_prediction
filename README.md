# House Price - Predictions

Competition Description

Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

Executive Summary

I started this competition by just focusing on getting a good understanding of the dataset. The EDA is detailed and many visualizations are included. This version also includes modeling:

XGBoost model
LGBM model
